# Gameplay 2 - L3akCTF 2024

Gamplay 1 had the flag [in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8B0tS_wcIo). Gameplay 2 starts in the same place but in the comment section.

As we can see, *@martini-craft* gave away his [Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/Feisty-Schedule1097/), which wasn't very full of stuff fortunately.

Here's where I got a bit lost as initially I couldn't find a way to read deleted comments, and none of the other stuff I was doing had any results... so I contacted the awesome stuff that created this CTF (:heart::heart::heart:) and they told me to keep trying with the deleted comments.

Eventually I found [this website](https://redditcommentsearch.com/) that provided me the info I needed, and I was able to access their [discord server](https://discord.gg/962JwKdE), where they had the flag.
